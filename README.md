Arduino firmware for a "Cone to Hank" winding machine
=======

- **Hardware Description**
  - MCU: Arduino Leonardo (atmega32u4)
  - Display: 1.3" 128x64 I2C SH1106 OLED Display
  - Navigation: Joystick module
  - Motor controller: L298N
  - Turn sensor: Optical detector 
  - Start/Pause/Stop button with embedded LED

- **Firmware features**
  - Navigation menu
    - Joystick control (up/down/left/right/select)
    - Configure number of turns and motor speed
    - Manual motor control
    - Save current settings as default in eeprom
  - Start/Stop/Pause button/led
  - Control motor (direction and speed/pwm)
  - Counts turns based on optical encoder inputs
  - Watchdog reset & recovery
  - Splash screen & screensaver

... only ~100 bytes left in SRAM between heap/stack ...

- **Development environment**
  - Microsoft's Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO IDE extension
  - Build targets:
    - leonardo  
      Release target (expect simavr in gdb mode [-g] for debug)
    - leonardo-mmcu  
      Include the .mmcu section to the ELF output (dropped otherwise)
      avr_mcu_section.c defines simavr parameters as well as addresses (I/O, SRAM, ...) to include in vcd output.
      e.g. monitor stack and heap trends (and clashes) over time as 'analog' signals
